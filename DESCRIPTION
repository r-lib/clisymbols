Description: A small subset of Unicode symbols, that are useful
    when building command line applications. They fall back to
    alternatives on terminals that do not support Unicode.
    Many symbols were taken from the 'figures' 'npm' package
    (see <https://github.com/sindresorhus/figures>).
